    For a set of bounding boxes to be valid it must satisfy the following conditions:
    - `bounding_boxes` must be a dictionary
    - contains keys `"boxes"` and `"classes"`
    - each entry must have matching first two dimensions; representing the batch axis
        and the number of boxes per image axis.
    - either both `"boxes"` and `"classes"` are batched, or both are unbatched

    Additionally, one of the following must be satisfied:
    - `"boxes"` and `"classes"` are both Ragged
    - `"boxes"` and `"classes"` are both Dense
    - `"boxes"` and `"classes"` are unbatched
