        include_top: whether to include the fully-connected layer at the top of
            the network.  If provided, `classes` must be provided.
        classes: optional number of classes to classify images into, only to be
            specified if `include_top` is True, and if no `weights` argument is
            specified.

        input_tensor: optional Keras tensor (i.e. output of `layers.Input()`)

        pooling: optional pooling mode for feature extraction when `include_top`
            is `False`.

                of the last convolutional block.

                output of the last convolutional block, and thus the output of the
                model will be a 2D tensor.
