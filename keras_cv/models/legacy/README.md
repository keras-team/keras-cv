# Legacy folder

These are models that we intend to migrate to the unified KerasNLP/KerasCV API 
but have not yet had the opporunity. We have verified that unit tests and 
pretrained weights are working, but will only check this manually going forward.

Do not use legacy models unless they fill a short term need and you are
comfortable moving to the new API once they are migrated. Anything which we
decide to never migrate will be deleted.
