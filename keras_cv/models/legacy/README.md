# Legacy folder

These are models that we intend to migrate to the unified KerasNLP/KerasCV API 
but have not yet had the opportunity. Units tests in this folder are run on
every PR.

Do not use legacy models unless they fill a short term need and you are
comfortable moving to the new API once they are migrated. Anything which we
decide to never migrate will be deleted.
