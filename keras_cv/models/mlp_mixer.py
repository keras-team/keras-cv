    This function returns a Keras MLP Mixer model.

    For transfer learning use cases, make sure to read the
    [guide to transfer learning & fine-tuning](https://keras.io/guides/transfer_learning/).

    Note that the `input_shape` should be fully divisible by the `patch_size`.

    Args:
      input_shape: tuple denoting the input shape, (224, 224, 3) for example.
      patch_size: tuple denoting the size of the patches to be extracted
        from the inputs ((16, 16) for example).
      num_blocks: number of mixer blocks.
      hidden_dim: dimension to which the patches will be linearly projected.
      tokens_mlp_dim: dimension of the MLP block responsible for tokens.
      channels_mlp_dim: dimension of the MLP block responsible for channels.
      include_rescaling: whether or not to Rescale the inputs.
        If set to True, inputs will be passed through a
        `Rescaling(1/255.0)` layer.
      include_top: whether to include the fully-connected
        layer at the top of the network.  If provided, classes must be provided.
      classes: optional number of classes to classify images
        into, only to be specified if `include_top` is True, and
        if no `weights` argument is specified.
      weights: one of `None` (random initialization), or a pretrained
        weight file path.
      input_tensor: optional Keras tensor (i.e. output of `layers.Input()`)
        to use as image input for the model.
      pooling: optional pooling mode for feature extraction
        when `include_top` is `False`.
        - `None` means that the output of the model will be
            the 4D tensor output of the
            last convolutional block.
        - `avg` means that global average pooling
            will be applied to the output of the
            last convolutional block, and thus
            the output of the model will be a 2D tensor.
        - `max` means that global max pooling will
            be applied.
      classifier_activation: A `str` or callable. The activation function to use
        on the "top" layer. Ignored unless `include_top=True`. Set
        `classifier_activation=None` to return the logits of the "top" layer.
        When loading pretrained weights, `classifier_activation` can only
        be `None` or `"softmax"`.
      name: (Optional) name to pass to the model.  Defaults to "DenseNet".

    Returns:
      A `keras.Model` instance.
