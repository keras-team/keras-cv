    """Randomly adjusts the hue on given images.

    This layer will randomly increase/reduce the hue for the input RGB
    images. At inference time, the output will be identical to the input.
    Call the layer with `training=True` to adjust the brightness of the input.

    The image hue is adjusted by converting the image(s) to HSV and rotating the
    hue channel (H) by delta. The image is then converted back to RGB.

    Args:
        factor: A tuple of two floats, a single float or `keras_cv.FactorSampler`.
            factor` controls the extent to which the image saturation is impacted.
            `factor`=`0.0`, `0.5` or `1.0` makes this layer perform a no-op operation.
            `factor=0.25` and `factor=0.75` makes the image to have fully opposite
            hue value. Values should be between `0.0` and `1.0`.
            If a tuple is used, a `factor` is sampled
            between the two values for every image augmented.  If a single float is
            used, a value between `0.0` and the passed float is sampled.
            In order to ensure the value is always the same, please pass a tuple with
            two identical floats: `(0.5, 0.5)`.
