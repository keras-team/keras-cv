    """Randomly adjusts the hue on given images.

    This layer will randomly increase/reduce the hue for the input RGB
    images. At inference time, the output will be identical to the input.
    Call the layer with `training=True` to adjust the brightness of the input.

    The image hue is adjusted by converting the image(s) to HSV and rotating the
    hue channel (H) by delta. The image is then converted back to RGB.

    Args:
        factor: A tuple of two floats, a single float or `keras_cv.FactorSampler`.
            `factor` controls the extent to which the image hue is impacted.
            `factor=0.0` makes this layer perform a no-op operation, while a value of
            1.0 performs the most aggressive contrast adjustment available.  If a tuple
            is used, a `factor` is sampled between the two values for every image
            augmented.  If a single float is used, a value between `0.0` and the passed
            float is sampled.  In order to ensure the value is always the same, please
            pass a tuple with two identical floats: `(0.5, 0.5)`.
        value_range:  the range of values the incoming images will have.
            Represented as a two number tuple written [low, high].
            This is typically either `[0, 1]` or `[0, 255]` depending
            on how your preprocessing pipeline is setup.
        seed: Integer. Used to create a random seed.
