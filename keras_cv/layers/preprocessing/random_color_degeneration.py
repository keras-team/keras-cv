class RandomColorDegeneration(tf.keras.__internal__.layers.BaseImageAugmentationLayer):
    """Randomly performs the color degeneration operation on given images.

    The sharpness operation first converts an image to gray scale, then back to color.
    It then takes a weighted average between original image and the degenerated image.
    This makes colors appear more dull.

    Args:
        factor: A tuple of two floats, a single float or a
            `keras_cv.FactorSampler`. `factor` controls the extent to which the
            image sharpness is impacted. `factor=0.0` makes this layer perform a no-op
            operation, while a value of 1.0 uses the degenerated result entirely.
            Values between 0 and 1 result in linear interpolation between the original
            image and the sharpened image.
            Values should be between `0.0` and `1.0`.  If a tuple is used, a `factor` is
            sampled between the two values for every image augmented.  If a single float
            is used, a value between `0.0` and the passed float is sampled.  In order to
            ensure the value is always the same, please pass a tuple with two identical
            floats: `(0.5, 0.5)`.
        seed: Integer. Used to create a random seed.
