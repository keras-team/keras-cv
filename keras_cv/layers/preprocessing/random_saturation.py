    """Randomly adjusts the saturation on given images.

    This layer will randomly increase/reduce the saturation for the input RGB
    images. At inference time, the output will be identical to the input.
    Call the layer with `training=True` to adjust the brightness of the input.

    Args:
        factor: A tuple of two floats, a single float or `keras_cv.FactorSampler`.
            `factor` controls the extent to which the image saturation is impacted.
            `factor=0.5` makes this layer perform a no-op operation. `factor=0.0` makes
            the image to be fully grayscale. `factor=1.0` makes the image to be fully
            saturated.
            Values should be between `0.0` and `1.0`. If a tuple is used, a `factor`
            is sampled between the two values for every image augmented.  If a single
            float is used, a value between `0.0` and the passed float is sampled.
            In order to ensure the value is always the same, please pass a tuple with
            two identical floats: `(0.5, 0.5)`.
        seed: Integer. Used to create a random seed.
