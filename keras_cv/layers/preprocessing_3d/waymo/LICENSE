Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents)
"Works" means the code located at keras_cv/layers/preprocessing_3d/waymo
licensed from Waymo LLC ("Waymo") for inclusion in the KerasCV project at
github.com/keras-team/keras-cv. “Patents" means the pending U.S. Patent App.
No. 63/418,259 and any issued patents arising therefrom. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this license, Waymo hereby grants to you a limited worldwide,
non-exclusive, royalty-free, personal patent license to make, have made, use,
and import the Works, where such license applies only to those Patent claims
that are necessarily infringed by the Works executing the ”preprocessing_3d”
augmentation library on 3D perception tasks using the
“lidaraugment_keraspolicy.py” file. This grant does not include claims that
would be infringed by combining the Works with other works, utilizing the Works
on other tasks, or as a consequence of further modification of the Works. If
you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order or agree to the
institution of patent litigation or any other patent enforcement activity
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that the Works or any activity using the Works to execute functions for
3D perception tasks constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, or
inducement of patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under
this license for the Works shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
filed.
