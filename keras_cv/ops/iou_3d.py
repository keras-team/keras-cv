    Note that this is implemented using a custom TensorFlow op. If you don't have
    KerasCV installed with custom ops, calling this will fail.

    Boxes should have the format CENTER_XYZ_DXDYDZ_PHI. Refer to
    https://github.com/keras-team/keras-cv/blob/master/keras_cv/bounding_box_3d/formats.py
    for more details on supported bounding box formats.

    Sample Usage:
    ```python
    y_true = [[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0], [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3 * math.pi / 4]]
    y_pred = [[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, math.pi / 4], [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0]]
