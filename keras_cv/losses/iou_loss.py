class IoULoss(keras.losses.Loss):
    """Implements the IoU Loss

    IoU loss is commonly used for object detection. This loss aims to directly
    optimize the IoU score between true boxes and predicted boxes. The length of
    the last dimension should be 4 to represent the bounding boxes. This loss
    uses IoUs according to box pairs and therefore, the number of boxes in both
    y_true and y_pred are expected to be equal i.e. the i<sup>th</sup>
    y_true box in a batch will be compared the i<sup>th</sup> y_pred box.

    Args:
        bounding_box_format: a case-insensitive string (for example, "xyxy").
            Each bounding box is defined by these 4 values. For detailed
            information on the supported formats, see the
            [KerasCV bounding box documentation](https://keras.io/api/keras_cv/bounding_box/formats/).
        mode: must be one of
            - `"linear"`. The loss will be calculated as 1 - iou
            - `"quadratic"`. The loss will be calculated as 1 - iou<sup>2</sup>
            - `"log"`. The loss will be calculated as -ln(iou)
            Defaults to "log".
        axis: the axis along which to mean the ious, defaults to -1.

    Sample Usage:
    ```python
    y_true = tf.random.uniform(
        (5, 10, 5),
        minval=0,
        maxval=10,
        dtype=tf.dtypes.int32)
    y_pred = tf.random.uniform(
        (5, 10, 4),
        minval=0,
        maxval=10,
        dtype=tf.dtypes.int32)
    loss = IoULoss(bounding_box_format = "xyWH")
    loss(y_true, y_pred).numpy()
    ```

    Usage with the `compile()` API:
    ```python
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=keras_cv.losses.IoULoss())
    ```
