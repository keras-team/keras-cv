    """Implements the Complete IoU (CIoU) Loss

    CIoU loss is an extension of GIoU loss, which further improves the IoU
    optimization for object detection. CIoU loss not only penalizes the
    bounding box coordinates but also considers the aspect ratio and center
    distance of the boxes. The length of the last dimension should be 4 to
    represent the bounding boxes.

    Args:
        bounding_box_format: a case-insensitive string (for example, "xyxy").
            Each bounding box is defined by these 4 values. For detailed
            information on the supported formats, see the [KerasCV bounding box
            documentation](https://keras.io/api/keras_cv/bounding_box/formats/).
        eps: A small value added to avoid division by zero and stabilize
            calculations.

    Sample Usage:
    ```python
    y_true = tf.random.uniform(
        (5, 10, 5),
        minval=0,
        maxval=10,
        dtype=tf.dtypes.int32)
    y_pred = tf.random.uniform(
        (5, 10, 4),
        minval=0,
        maxval=10,
        dtype=tf.dtypes.int32)
    loss = keras_cv.losses.CIoULoss()
    loss(y_true, y_pred).numpy()
    ```

    Usage with the `compile()` API:
    ```python
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=CIoULoss())
    ```
