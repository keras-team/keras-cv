    """CENTER_XYZ_DXDYDZ_PHI contains axis indices for the CENTER_XYZ_DXDYDZ_PHI format.

    CENTER_XYZ_DXDYDZ_PHI is a 3D box format that supports vertical boxes with a
    heading rotated around the Z axis.

    The CENTER_XYZ_DXDYDZ_PHI format consists of the following required indices:

    - X: X coordinate of the center of the bounding box
    - Y: Y coordinate of the center of the bounding box
    - Z: Z coordinate of the center of the bounding box
    - DX: size of the bounding box on the x-axis
    - DY: size of the bounding box on the y-axis
    - DZ: size of the bounding box on the z-axis
    - PHI: the rotation of the box with respect to the z axis, in radians

    and the following optional indices, used in some KerasCV components:

    - CLASS: class of the object contained in the bounding box
